Tycoon is a prototype decision support system for playing poker online. It is the result of my final degree project and its main objective is to try to extract knowledge in stochastic environments and with imperfect information, such as No Limit Texas Holdem Poker.

As knowledge extraction methodology, the one described in the papar "The KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data" (Usama M. Fayyad, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro and P. Smyth, [1996](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/240455.240464))
is used.
